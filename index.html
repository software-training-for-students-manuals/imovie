            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>iMovie is video editing software created by Apple; it can be found on practically all Mac computers. iMovie collects and organizes footage, allows users to edit the footage in a variety of ways. From there, the final video can be exported and saved.</p>
            <h2>Prerequisites and Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Basic computer operation skills</p>
                </li>

            <h1>Copyright and Fair Use</h1>
            <p>A common problem when creating mulimedia presentations, such as those you will make with iMovie, is obtaining footage, audio and images to work with. Many times we casually use video clips, audio files, and images without thinking or realizing they are copyrighted. Copyright law protects these files, and generally prevents us from using them in our own projects. The following information is meant to help inform you about good practices regarding Fair Use of multimedia, enable you to create copyright-conscious works, which will stand up to scrutiny.</p>
            <h2>Gathering Media</h2>
            <p>The best way to obtain media is to produce it yourself! When you produce your own footage, sound, and images, you retain intellectual ownership, and thus are allowed to use them any way you want. Of course it is not always practical or deasible to create all of your media from scratch. There are standards of practie that allow you to use media created by others.</p>
            <h3>Fair Use</h3>
            <p>The Fair Use Doctrine allows for the usage of normally copyrighted materials in certain circumstances. Fair Use suspends copyright law, allowing and encouraging the use of copyrighted materials in culturally and socially beneficial applications such as education, learning and scholarship. The application of the Fair Use doctrine is not black and white, and is left mostly to your own discretion. To access a more comprehensive description of the Fair Use Doctrine and examples of its usage please visit the copyright section of the library's website: <a href="https://www.library.wisc.edu/help/copyright/">library.wisc.edu/help/copyright</a>.</p>
            <h3>CreativeCommons Licenses</h3>
            <p>CreativeCommons is a nonprofit organization that works to legally extend the use of copyrighted information. CreativeCommons provides legal tools, in the form of CreativeCommons licenses, that allow a creator to express their desire for others to be allowed to reuse their work. Basically the creator is saying that others are permitted to use their work without any direction authorization. This is meant to encourage the creative process and foster the idea of the internet as a collectively creative community. For more information on the CreativeCommons project visit their website at <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/">creativecommons.org/about</a>.</p>
            <h2>Where to Find Content?</h2>

            <h1>iMovie Interface</h1>
            <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/iMovie-logo.jpg"> </div>
            <p>To open iMovie, go ahead to your launchpad or application folder and click on the purple iMovie icon.</p>
            <h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Once iMovie has opened, "New Movie" then "No Theme". Then name your project.</span> For our example project, we will name it "Holi". We will briefly mention how to use iMovie to make a trailer at the end of this class. If you are interested in other pre-designed themes, we also encourage you to explore more after this class. This class will focus on how to teach you basic video editing skills without using these pre-designed themes.</p>

            <h2>iMovie Workspace</h2>
            <p>iMovie's workspace consists of five major areas, labeled below.</p>
            <div class="full-width-image"> <img src="images/workspace.png"> </div>
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <div class="sidebyside-image-large"> <img src="images/CL-01.png"> <img src="images/CL-02.png">
                    <p>Sound Effects and Transitions</p>
                    <p></p>
                </div>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Event Library: </b>This library stores all video clips, photos, audio clips, and other media that you imported in any of the projects in the specfied event.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Adjustment Menu: </b>This menu brings up options you can use to modify and enhance your video clips, audio clips, images, text, and other objects in your projects.</p>
                </li>

                    <p><b>Preview Screen: </b>Window where you can preview your footage. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Timeline (Project Area): </b>This is the area where the editing happens. You can drag, split, cut, and arrange your footage to create the final movie output here.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Gathering Media</h2>
            <p>There are a variety of ways to add media such as pictures, videos, and music to your project. In this section we will learn how to import files, and record video to add to our project.</p>
            <h3>Importing Video Files</h3>
            <p>If you have digital video or still images on your computer's hard drive, or on an external hard drive, you can easily import them into your iMovie project. </p>
            <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/importing-project.png"> </div>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>Choose the project you just created under Project Media area, and click "Import Media".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Navigate to iMovie class files. Hold shift and select all excercise videos, images and audio files.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Click "Import Selected".</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This may take a minute. Once the files have imported, you will see that each video appears as it's own individual tile in the event library. </p>
            <h3>Recording Video</h3>
            <p>If your laptop or computer has a built-in camera, it can connect to iMovie and record videos.</p>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>Choose the project you just created under Project Media area, right click and select "Import Media".</p>
                    <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/importing-project2.png"> </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Under cameras, choose FaceTime HD Camera.</p>
                    <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/importing-facetime.png"> </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Press the record button (red dot) to record directly from your computer's camera. You will now be able to record a video and import it directly into your event library.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Video Skimming and Playback</h2>
            <p>Before editing the video, you may need a little bit of time to get familar with all the media you have. iMovie has a very helpful video playback system, with multiple ways of preview your footage. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Hover your mouse from left to right over a clip to preview it. If you want to listen to the audio while you skim through your video clips, go to <span class="type-text">View > Audio Skimming.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Press the <em>spacebar</em> or play button under the preview screen to play back video in real time, press again to pause.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Organizing Footage</h3>
            <p>There are multiple ways to organize your videos. This can be helpful if you have a lot of media files to deal with.</p>
            <p>The gear icon in the top-right corner of the media area can adjust the appearace of thumbnails for each of your video clips. If you have a plethora of footage, it may be good to derease the clip size and change the zoom level.</p>
            <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/organizing-adjustthumb.png"> </div>
            <p>Another key task in organizing footage is to filter out unwanted clips. You can "Favorite" or "Reject" a clip by selecting it, right-clicking, then selecting "Favorite" or "Reject".</p>
            <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/organizing-favrej.png"> </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Favorite: </strong>This will highlight your clip with a green bar in the library.</p>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reject:</strong> Will hightlight your clip with a red bar and by default hide your clips from the library.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Unrate:</b> If the selected clip has been highlighted, clicking on this option will remove the highlight.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now you can filter you clips by showing only favorite, rejected, or all clips. Pretty neat, eh?</p>

            <h1>Basic Editing</h1>
            <div class="sidebar-note">
                <h2>Leaving Markers</h2>
                <p>When you have many video files, editing can become overwhelming. You can ease out the process by making marks at points you think is important. To make a mark, simply press M.</p> <img src="images/create-mark2.png">
            </div>
            <p>In order to start building our video, we need to place video clips into the timeline of our project. <span class="highlight">Click on a clip to select it, then drag your selection to the empty timeline (project area) below.</span></p>
            <p>You may also select only a portion of a clip by clicking and dragging on the clip in the media area.</p>
            <div class="centered-image-small"> <img src="images/create-zoom.png"> </div>
            <p>Finally, you can zoom in/out of timeline by adjust the slider on the top-right corner of the timeline.</p>
            <h2>Trimming a Clip</h2>
            <p>After adding a clip to the timeline, you may want to trim either the beginning or end of the clip.</p>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>In the project area, select your clip, then move your mouse to the left or right edge of the clip. Your cursor should change, indicating you are about to trim a clip.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Click and drag to whatever position you like to trim the clip.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Practice the trimming technique on another video clip in the project library. <span class="highlight">You should now have a multiple selections from the few clips in your project.</span> </p>
            <h2>Spliting a Clip</h2>
            <div class="sidebar-note">
                <h2>Splitting a Clip</h2>
                <p>If you find yourself splitting clips often, you may simplify the process by placing the playhead where you would like to split the clip, then pressing <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> on your keyboard.</p>
            </div>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>Place the playhead at the location where you want to split the clip.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Right-click, then choose "Split Clip" from the menu that appears.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Image Editing</h2>
            <p>In iMove, editing images follows a similar process to editing video clips.</p>
            <p>Simply select and drag the file into the timeline. iMovie by default sets the image duration to 4 seconds. You can change the duration in timeline by hovering your mouse to the right or left edge of the image and dragging to whatever duration you want. This is essentially similar to how you trim a video clip. </p>
            <h2>Audio Editing</h2>
            <p>Many beginners in filmmaking often make a common mistake: omit the importance of audio quality. In fact, audio can sometimes be even more important than video because people are more likely to endure a bad-quality video than bad-quality audio.</p>
            <p>iMovie includes some basic audio editing tools to help improve audio. Look at your timeline, you will notice there is a blue waveform section under each video clip. This waveform displays the audio attached to the video clip. There are a few functions you can perform here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>To change the volume of the audio, hover your mouse on the horizontal black line, and drag up or down to increase/decrease volume.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Hover your mouse over the audio clip, and you will notice a small blue circle near the beginning and end of the waveform. These circles control the fade-in/fade-out effects. Drag the circle right or left to create fade.</p>
                </li>
                <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/editing-fade.png"> </div>
                <li>
                    <p>You can also detach an audio clip by right-clicking on a clip and choosing "Detach Audio". Your video and audio clips are now separate entities, and will no longer move around the timeline in tandem.</p>
                </li>
                <div class="sidebyside-image-large"> <img src="images/editing-detachau.png"> <img src="images/editing-detachaudio.png">
                    <p>Detach audio gives you more freedom to move around audio.</p>
                </div>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="topic">
            <h1>Advanced Editing Tools</h1>
            <h2>Adjustment Menu</h2>
            <p>The adjustment menu (found in the upper right corner) is where you can fine tune your video, add effects, color correct, and change all sorts of properties. Many of the tools in the adjustment menu may sound abstract, but fear not. The best way to learn how to use the more advanced tools is to play with htem and try out different options.</p>
            <p>Below is a diagram with the name of each tool found in the adjustment menu.</p>
            <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/adediting-AdMenu.png"> </div>
            <h3>Auto Correct</h3>
            <p>Auto Correct automatically improve the video and audio quality of selected clips.</p>
            <div class="sidebyside-image-large"> <img src="images/adEditing-AC1.png"> <img src="images/adEditing-AC2.png">
                <p>Before and after Auto Correct</p>
            </div>
            <p>Because our original clip is a bit desaturated, iMovie adds will automatically add more contrast to the and color to the footage. To gain more control of your clip, avoid using auto correct.</p>
            <h3>Color Balance</h3>
            <p>In iMovie, the color balance tools have four main functions. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Auto</strong>: Automatically balances the color of your video.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Match Color</strong>: Adjust the color of this clip to mach the colors of another clip. This is helpful if you have color corrected one clip in your timeline, and which to apply those color corrections to other clips as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>White Balance</strong>: Allows you to select a pure white color within your image. Whatever color you selected, iMovie will set it as pure white, and then adjust all other colors accordingly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Skin Tone Balance</strong>: Allows you to select skin tones in your footage, then properly balances their colors.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Color Correction</h3>
            <p>Color correction allows you to change the color scheme, brightness, saturation and color temperature of your footage. </p>
            <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/adediting-cc.png"> </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Shadows:</b> Adjust to make the dark area of the clip brighter or darker.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Midtone:</b> Adjust to make the entire clip brighter or darker.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Contrast:</b> Adjust to make the clip to have more or less contrast. Contrast is the scale of difference between black and white.</p>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Cropping</h3>
            <p>Cropping an image allows you to get a better composition of your clip. <span class="highlight">Select "Crop to Fill", adjust and drag the highlighted area to the composition you want, click check button on the right top corner to finish cropping.</span></p>
            <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/adediting-crop.png"> </div>
            <p>Make sure to not crop too much because your footage is going to lose its high resolution, especially if you are using a low resolution camera.</p>
            <p>Another feature under the cropping tool is the <strong>Ken Burns effect.</strong> This effect will apply a zooming and panning motion to your picture/video throughout the duration of the clip, depending on where you set the beginning and endpoints.</p>
            <p>Ken Burns was the creator of many famous PBS documentaries. He added this animation to still photos to add interest and draw the viewer's attention. Hence, the feature has been named after him.</p>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>Select a photo or a clip in the project area.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Under crop tool, select "Ken Burns".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There are two boxes: a start box and an end box, each labeled in he lower left corner of each frame. The start box is where the animation of the picture will begin. Move and resize the box until it covers the area where you would like the animation to begin.</p>
                </li>
                <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/adediting-kenburn.png"> </div>
                <p>Notice the arrow in the center of the Start box that is indicating the direction in which the animation will occur.</p>
                <li>
                    <p>Next, click inside the end box. This is where the animation of the photo will end. Adjust the size and position of the ending box where you would like the animation to finish.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Preview your effect with the play button in the preview screen. Click on the check button on the right-top corner to finish the effect.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/adediting-rotate.png"> </div>
            <p>One final feature of the cropping sectin is the ability to rotate a video clip or still image. You can achieve this by clicking one of the rotate buttons found at the top.</p>
            <h3>Stablization</h3>
            <p>If you handheld taking videos, you often find the footage very shaky and difficult to watch. Click on the shaky camera icon under adjustment menu, <span class="highlight">check stabilize shaky video and adjust the amount of stabilization.</span> iMovie will analyze and stabilize the video automatically. However, remember the more you want to stablize the video, the more iMovie may crop the clip to cover the shakiness.</p>

            <h1>Movie Trailers</h1>
            <p>iMovie includes a number of templates you can use to create movie trailers, with themes that range from adventure, to documentary, to romance, to friendship to drama. Each template lets you customize screen text such as the movie title and credits, and add clips from your own videos to build a visually appealing trailer. Each templates also comes with a musical score that matches the theme of the trailer.</p>
            <p>Movie Trailers are designed to be complete projects in their own right, but you can convert any trailer to a project, which you can then edit just as you would any other video.</p>
            <h2>Creating a Trailer</h2>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/trailer-create.png"> </div>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Select a trailer theme from the window that appears, then click<strong>&nbsp;</strong>"Create". Each theme has a sample film, click on it to preview the film.</p>
                </li>
                <p>You can't switch templates once you begin creating your project because the required elements from one template won't fit with a different template. If you want to use a different template for your project, you need to create a new trailer from the beginning.</p>
                <li>
                    <p>Type a name for the trailer project and click <b>OK</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <p>A tabbed interface appears. Enter information about your movie in the Outline Tab and add video to your trailer in the Storyboard and Shot List tabs.</p>
            </ol>
            <h2>Using the Storyboard</h2>
            <p>The storyboard includes text bars at the top (and at other intervals) that let you edit onscreen text. There are also wells with placeholder imagery to which you add video clips to build your project.</p>
            <p>The text bars and wells are arranged in the order in which the elements appear in your trailer, but you can edit or fill them in any order you like.</p>

            <h1>Saving and Exporting</h1>
            <p>You have successfully created a project in iMovie! It may be short, but hopefully you are now more familiar with how to use iMovie to make your own videos. Before you exit iMovie, take a look at some of the options you have for sharing your video. You will need to export your video in order to upload it, or send it to other people.</p>
            <div class="side-image-large"> <img src="images/export-sharemenu.png"> </div>
            <ul class="instruction-list">
                <li>
                    <p>Click the share icon on the top right corner of iMovie.</p>
                </li>
                <p>Notice that you can even export your video to <b>YouTube</b> and <b>iTunes</b>! These options requires you to link your account with iMovie. </p>
                <p> You can choose <b>File</b> if you want to export a QuickTime movie optimized for iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, computer viewing, or Mac. </p>
                <li>
                    <p>Select "File" from the options given. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Select the quality you wish to export. For best quality, choose Best (ProRes) and Better Quality. Notice the file size will be very large. For smaller file size, choose High quality.</p>
                </li>
                <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/export-file.png"> </div>
                <li>
                    <p>Make sure "Add to Theatre" is checked, and click "Next..."</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Choose the destination where you will save your movie file, and click save.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your project will be rendered and saved as a <span class="type-text">.mp4</span> file. to the destination you specified. </p>
            <p><strong>Be careful to always leave time for exporting, the process may take over an hour for a large file.</strong> Don't wait until five minutes before your project is due to export your movie. </p>
            <p>After you successfully exporting your movie, you will recieve a confirmation message.</p>
            <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/export-success.png"> </div>
            <p>You don't need to worry about saving the project file. iMovie automatically saves it for your. Unless you delete it, you project will be accessible every time you open iMovie. Keep in mind, the iMovie project file is only readable in iMovie and can't be played with video player.</p>
